IOException :
An IOException is any unexpected problem the JVM encounters while attempting to run a program.
When an IOException is thrown, it means that whatever is throwing the exception (perhaps a try{}-catch block that reads
data from a file) can throw an IOException, for example if the file is not found, corrupted, etc, or when the file is
otherwise unable to be read, or any other of a list of issues that can occur with the IO package and it's extensions.
